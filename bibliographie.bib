	abstract = {A wide variety of modern chess software products is available to the modern professional and amateur chess players alike, helping them improve their chess skills and prepare for online and traditional tournaments. These products include chess user interfaces (UIs), traditional Alpha-Beta (AB) and emergent Neural Network (NN) chess engines, game databases, opening databases and electronic books, chess-specific cloud services, tournament broadcast tools, online tutorials, tactical problem collections, and endgame tablebases (EGTBs). All of these tools except the last two categories can be used to work on opening preparation, an important component of chess training. In this paper, the author presents his computer-based approach to opening preparation tested in chess classes at the Russian School of Indiana for advanced beginner players. The materials used to develop the approach included game openings from the games played in the Free Open-Source Chess Engine Contest (FOSCEC) broadcast online by the author’s CIT students at Purdue Polytechnic Columbus. We will discuss the choices of tools and equipment, how the more popular and/or promising opening variations were identified and analyzed, the lessons learned, and the future work.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses empirically and theoretically a question derived from the chunking theory of memory (Chase \& Simon, 1973a, 1973b): To what extent is skilled chess memory limited by the size of short-term memory (about seven chunks)? This question is addressed first with an experiment where subjects, ranking from class A players to grandmasters, are asked to recall up to five positions presented during 5 s each. Results show a decline of percentage of recall with additional boards, but also show that expert players recall more pieces than is predicted by the chunking theory in its original form. A second experiment shows that longer latencies between the presentation of boards facilitate recall. In a third experiment, a Chessmaster gradually increases the number of boards he can reproduce with higher than 70\% average accuracy to nine, replacing as many as 160 pieces correctly. To account for the results of these experiments, a revision of the Chase–Simon theory is proposed. It is suggested that chess players, like experts in other recall tasks, use long-term memory retrieval structures (Chase \& Ericsson, 1982) or templates in addition to chunks in short-term memory to store information rapidly.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm is presented which takes into account both shallow and deep cut-offs. A formula is first developed to measure the average number of terminal nodes examined by the algorithm in a uniform tree of degree n and depth d when ties are allowed among the bottom positions: specifically, all bottom values are assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables drawn from a discrete probability distribution. A worst case analysis over all possible probability distributions is then presented by considering the limiting case when the discrete probability distribution tends to a continuous probability distribution. The branching factor of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm is shown to grow with n as Θ(n/lnn), therefore confirming a claim by Knuth and Moore that deep cut-offs only have a second order effect on the behavior of the algorithm.},

Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo’s own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo’s games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100–0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},
